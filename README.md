# Rails' Forms

##### Project 5

#### A Rails project center in using its internal POST request for user inputs

## About

The gist of this project was the use of Rails' View Forms in the creation of user input forms. It handles the creation and update of an user, but it doesn't have a dedicated page for rendering the created users; use the Rails Console to see them.

## Details

This is an old project, and the gems used may not be up to date, run the

```
$ bundle update
```

command to fix any version errors or fix them manually.

## Installation

If you want to see this project in action, clone the repository and install the bundled gems with

```
$ bundle install
```

Then, migrate the database with

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

And finally, to run the app locally, use

```
$ rails server
```

To see the list of created users, enter Rails Console with the command

```
$ rails console
```
